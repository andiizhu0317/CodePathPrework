## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The challenge that I encountered while building the app was waiting for the app to Run. Often, I thought that I was doing something wrong because when the iPhone simulator opened, and it led to the default background or just a white screen. Because I was impatient, I kept trying to see if there was something in the code or if I followed any of the steps incorrectly. It wasn't until I stepped away and left my computer to return to seeing that the build has finally finished building/rendering.
